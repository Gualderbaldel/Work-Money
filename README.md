Welcome to my project! Over the summers of 2023 and 2024, I worked as a food runner at a restaurant in Marblehead, Ma. Over these two summers, I tracked data on how many hours I worked, my tip-out, and the online tips that I got from online orders. Originally, this was a pursuit of keeping track of the money I made (and making sure that I was tipped out the correct amount). Over time, I started creating more metrics from these three variables, such as cumulative income and taxed cumulative income (you can see the spreadsheet). I also made a bunch of charts to visualize the make-up of my income. Fast-forward to taking Adv. intro to Stats. and Data Science, I learned how to do more things with data, like hypothesis testing. I was thinking about how I could get my hands on good data to practice this new material.
